### Community-Driven Language for Variability Models

The **U**niversal **V**ariability **L**anguage is a community effort towards a unified language for variability models. UVL is a direct result of the efforts within the <a href="https://modevar.github.io/">MODEVAR</a> initiative. *Do you have any questions on UVL?* *Do you want to contribute?* *We gladly receive your message [(Contact)](mailto:chico.sundermann@uni-ulm.de).*


# Language Design

UVL specifies variability models with a tree-like structure to represent the hierarchical structure of variability models. Below you can see a simple example of a variability model in UVL. The tree structure is visualized on the right side in the [FeatureIDE](https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatureIDE) representation. The language core of UVL comes with several concepts to specify constraints:

* *Mandatory*: The feature needs to be selected if its parent is selected
* *Optional*: The feature can be selected if its parent is selected
* *Or*: At least one of the children need to be selected if its parent is selected
* *Alternative*: Exactly one of the children needs to be selected
* *Cross-tree constraints*: Arbitrary propositional constraints over the features

<pre>
<code>
<b>features</b>
    Sandwich
        <b>mandatory</b>
            Bread
        <b>optional</b>
            Sauce
                <b>alternative</b>
                    Ketchup
                    Mustard
            Cheese
<b>constraints</b>
    Ketchup => Cheese
</code>
</pre>


## Language Levels

In addition to the language core described above, UVL provides several extensions providing additional language constructs. The following language levels are supported:

* Boolean Level
    * Boolean Core: Level without any extension as seen above
    * Group Cardinality: Specify selecting [n..m] (between n and m) children parent-children relationships D
* Arithmetic Level
    * Arithmetic Core: Supports constraints over feature attributes with standard arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/,=,!=,>,<)
    * Attribute aggregates: Simplifies specification of attribute constraints by allowing sum() and avg() aggregates
    * Feature Cardinality: A single feature can be selected between n and m times
* Type Level
    * Type Core: Supports String Features 
    * Type Numeric-Constraints: Allows numeric operations like floor(..) and ceil(..) within constraints
    * Type String-Constraints: Allows string operations like len(..) and comparison (of String Features) within constraints

The following feature model in UVL syntax enriches the previous version with new language concepts. Further, feature attributes, such as the number of calories, are attached to features.

                    Ketchup {Calories 40, Sugar 35}
                    Mustard {Calories 25, Sugar 5}
            Cheese
                <b>[0..2]</b> <i>// Group cardinality</i>
                    Cheddar {Calories 60}

## Examples
A set of further example UVL models is available [here](https://github.com/Universal-Variability-Language/uvl-models). We are happy to merge your examples if you want to [contribute](https://github.com/Universal-Variability-Language/uvl-models/pulls).

## Grammar
Below you can find a simplified grammar for UVL in [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) notation. This simplified version is supposed to provide a quick overview on the structure of an UVL model but leaves out many details. A full version of this grammar can be found [here](https://github.com/Universal-Variability-Language/uvl-parser2.0/blob/main/src/main/antlr4/de/vill/UVL.g4).
